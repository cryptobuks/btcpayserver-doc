## Creating a Store in BTCPay

Inside BTCPay, you can create and manage an unlimited number of stores. Each store has its own wallet, can create apps (Point of Sale, Payment Buttons and Crowdfunding) or be paired with external e-commerce software through one of many available [integrations](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/integrations/).

To create a store, make sure you're logged in into your account, and go to > <strong>Stores</strong> in the upper navigation menu. Click on the <strong>create a new store</strong> button. Enter the store name into the text field and click `Create`.
