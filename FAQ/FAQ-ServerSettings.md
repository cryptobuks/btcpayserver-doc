### How to update BTCPay Server

There are 2 ways to update your BTCPay Server :
1. Updating through the front end: Server Settings > Maintenance > Update.

![Updating BTCPay Server](/img/HowToUpdateBTCPayServer.png)

2.Updating through SSH: Login into your virtual machine with ssh, then apply following commands:

```
sudo su -
btcpay-update.sh
```

### How can I see my BTCPay version?
You can see your BTCPay version in the bottom right of the page footer when you're logged in as a server admin.

### How can I check my BTCPay Server version via terminal?
In the btcpayserver-docker folder:`bitcoin-cli.sh getnetworkinfo`

### What is BTCPay SSH key file?
BTCPay SSH key, enables users to update their server or quickly change the domain name from btcpay website, the front-end.

### Forgot BTCPay Admin password?
You need to edit your database.

First, register a new user on your BTCPay Server, by clicking "Register", for example: "newadmin@example.com".
If you can't create a new user because registrations are disabled in your Server Settings > Policies, you need to reset the policies settings with the following command line: 

Please skip this step if you can create a new user on the front-end.

```bash
# In root
sudo su -
# Connect to your postgres container
docker exec -ti $(docker ps -a -q -f "name=postgres_1") bash
# Switch to postgres user
su postgres
# Run psql
psql
# Connect to db
\c btcpayservermainnet
DELETE FROM "Settings" WHERE "Id" = 'BTCPayServer.Services.PoliciesSettings';
```

Head back to your BTCPay Server and click on the "Register" which should now be enabled. In case you don't see the Register link in the menu, that's probably because of the caching. Restart your btcpay with `btcpay-down.sh` then `btcpay-up.sh`.

Next, add a newly registered user `newadmin@example.com` as an admin:

```bash
# In root
sudo su -
# Connect to your postgres container
docker exec -ti $(docker ps -a -q -f "name=postgres_1") bash
# Switch to postgres user
su postgres
# Run psql
psql
# Connect to db
\c btcpayservermainnet
INSERT INTO "AspNetUserRoles" Values ( (SELECT "Id" FROM "AspNetUsers" WHERE "Email"='newadmin@example.com'), (SELECT "Id" FROM "AspNetRoles" WHERE "NormalizedName"='SERVERADMIN'));
```
Now you can access with `newadmin@example.com` as admin.

When you apply the changes, you'll noticed that newly created user isn't the member of any stores. In that case, [follow this guide](https://gist.github.com/justinmoon/8128e66fc11d90ae5732f2491570bfc5) to add the new users to all or certain stores.

## BTCPAY_SSHKEYFILE is not set when running the docker install, or unable to update through Server Settings / Maintenance

You may see such the following message when you run your docker-compose (either via `btcpay-up.sh` or `btcpay-setup.sh`):

```bash
WARNING: The BTCPAY_SSHKEYFILE variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
WARNING: The BTCPAY_SSHTRUSTEDFINGERPRINTS variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
```

`BTCPay Server` requires SSH access, to allow you to perform the following tasks from the front-end:

* Updating the server
* Changing the domain name of the server

You can run the following command line to give access to BTCPay to your server via SSH.

```bash 
sudo su -
cd $BTCPAY_BASE_DIRECTORY/btcpayserver-docker
git checkout master
# Setup SSH access via private key
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /root/.ssh/id_rsa_btcpay -q -P "" -m PEM
echo "# Key used by BTCPay Server" >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa_btcpay.pub >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
BTCPAY_HOST_SSHKEYFILE=/root/.ssh/id_rsa_btcpay
. ./btcpay-setup.sh -i
```
### How to configure SMTP settings in BTCPay?
Each e-mail provider has different configuration, so we can't provide you with exact setup, but here's the configuration for gmail which should work:
```
SMTP Host: smtp.gmail.com
SMTP Port: 587
SSL Protocol: ON
TLS Protocol: ON
SMTP Username: (your Gmail username)
SMTP Password: (your Gmail password)
```
If by any chance you have 2-step verification added to your gmail account, [visit this article](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en).

### How to SSH into my BTCPay running on VPS?
Follow these instructions to connect via [SSH into your virtual machine](https://github.com/JeffVandrewJr/patron/blob/master/SSH.md).

## Theme / Customization

### How to customize my BTCPay theme style
There are two ways to customize the theme of your BTCPay.
The easy way is to head over to the **Server Settings > Theme** and follow the instructions on how to [change your Bootstrap theme](/Theme.md#bootstrap-themes).

For advanced theme changes, you'll most likely need to fork  BTCPay repository and apply desired design changes. Build and publish the docker image to Docker Hub. Set the `BTCPAY_IMAGE` environment variable to your docker image tag(`export BTCPAY_IMAGE="your custom btcpay docker image"`) and run the setup (`. ./btcpay-setup.sh -i`) as usual from [BTCPay Docker](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-docker). Modify generated docker compose to use your custom docker image. **You will need to create a new image manually and follow these steps for EACH BTCPay update so it is advised to stick with the default setup.**
### How to add Google Analytics code to BTCPay
You should be able to do what you want by injecting your GA code to ~/wwwroot/checkout/js/core.js. Might be the easiest way but you have to redo it every time you update BTCPay to the latest version. Then you wonâ€™t have the hassle of forking the code, deploying it manually. Every time there is an update. Just do the docker update and add the same lines to the js file.
### How to modify the checkout page?
You can easily change the appearance of your BTCPay's checkout page by following the [instructions here](/Theme.md#checkout-page-theme)

## Policies

### How to allow registration on my BTCPay Server
To allow other users to register and use your server, in Server Settings > Policies enable registration. If you [configured SMTP properly](FAQ-ServerSettings.md#how-to-configure-smtp-settings-in-btcpay), you can request users e-mail confirmation to prevent spam or bot registrating on your instance.

### How to hide my BTCPay Server from Search Engines
Discouraging search engines from indexing your site in Server Settings > Policies, adds `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` to your server header, which informs search engines not to index your pages. 

It is up to search engines to honor this request, and may take time for your pages to disappear completely. Unfortunatelly, the exact time is beyond our control, it depends on crawl bots of particular search engine like Google.

## Services

### How to remotely connect to my BTCPay full node?

If you're using an external wallet which allows BTC-P2P connection, you can easily connect it to your BTCPay full node. By doing this, you avoid leaking information to third-party servers and are soley relying on your own full node. 
To connect to a compatible BTC-P2P wallet, go to **Server Settings > Services > Full node P2P** Reveal the QR code and scan it with a BTC-P2P compatible wallet, or input it by copy-pasting it.

![BTC-P2P](/img/BTC-P2P.png)

If you do not see Full node P2P in your Services, you probably have to [activate Tor on your server](FAQ-Deployment.md#how-do-i-activate-tor-on-my-btcpay-server).

## Files

### How to upload files to BTCPay
To upload files to your BTCPay Server instance, first under Server Settings > Services, enable the External Storage feature and choose which storage service provider you would like to use. Next, go to Server Settings > Files to browse and upload local files. Depending on the limitations of your storage system, you may have difficulty uploading large files.
